## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a manual Web Application Vulnerability Assessment (WAVT) performed on a deliberately vulnerable application in a controlled lab environment. The objective was to identify, validate, and document common OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities using ethical testing methodologies.

No real-world systems were tested, and exploitation was limited strictly to proof-of-concept only.
